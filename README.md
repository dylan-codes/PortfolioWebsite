# Portfolio
 This is a portfolio page created for a project in my Software Development for the Web class!


I wanted my first project to be the start of my new interactive resume, meant to be sent out to possible employers.
My idea was to create something simple enough for someone to see who I am, what I do, and all my work without having to
click through a lot of menus.

The page itself still requires work, if I'd had more time I would have added a Navigation bar that would skip to parts of the page (Ex: if the user clicks "Projects!" the page will skip straight to my projects). Another milestone is to create a better contact portion of my page, with a form and possible background data queries to allow me to keep up with messages or requests people might send me. Other milestones would be using the @media CSS rule to make my site more responsive for different screen resolutions, bringing my Battleship Web App online, and sprucing up my About Me section. I will continue to work on this project in hopes to send it out to future employers!


For the dynamic typing animation on my header I used a JavaScript library created by Matt Boldt. You can find it here:

The font used was found on Google Fonts and all logos were found at FontAwesome!
